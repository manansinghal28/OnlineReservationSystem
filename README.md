# OnlineReservationSystem
The Online Reservation System is a Java program that allows users to reserve train tickets, cancel their reservations, and exit the system. It uses a HashMap to store login credentials and an ArrayList to store reservations. The program prompts the user to select an option, either to reserve a ticket or to cancel an existing reservation. If the user selects the reservation option, they are prompted to enter their personal details and the details of their journey. Upon successful reservation, a unique PNR number is generated. If the user selects the cancellation option, they are prompted to enter their PNR number, and if a reservation is found with that PNR number, it is cancelled.
